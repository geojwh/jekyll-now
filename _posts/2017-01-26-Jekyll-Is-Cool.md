title: Jekyll is Pretty Cool!
---

This is another test of jekyll using the jekyll-now repo on GitHub. 
I wanted to enter another blog post to see how the site organizes the multiple posts.

This is definitely a good option for setting up the centexgis site I think. I just need to get more familiar with jekyll and then I can proceed to designing a new site for centexgis or properly editing the existing jekyll content.

Regards,
